1. Storage management and security features
   - For GCP IAM Permissions, there are immense options and roles to choose from in order to allow for an efficient way to assign specific roles to projects and manage permissions. Then, there are four storage class options which are standard, nearline, coldline, and archive. Furthermore, for lifecycle management, users can configure lifecycle rules to manage automatic manage objects by setting actions as well as specify unique retention policies.

1. Storage management and security features
  - For Azure access policies, there are Shared Access Signatures (SAS) that provide access to containers and blobs and Stored Access Policies as a way of managing those permissions. Then, similar to GCP, there are four storage access tiers which are hot, cool, cold, and archive. Furthermore, the Azure Monitor feature allows users to view metrics from multiple storage accounts to help identify areas for improvement.
